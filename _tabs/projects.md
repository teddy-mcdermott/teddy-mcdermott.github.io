Here are some of my projects:

- [**Hacker News Analysis**]({{ "/posts/Analysing-Hacker-News/" | relative_url }}) — A complete data pipeline for collecting, storing, and analysing the entire history of Hacker News.  Gives some key insights such as the most influential users and keyword trends!

- [**LifeMap**]({{ "/posts/LifeMap/" | relative_url }}) — A Task Management program, for organising your life.
