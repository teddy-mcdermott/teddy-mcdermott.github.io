Each year, I'm invariably blindsided by the overwhelming, unguiding freedom that a clear summer schedule provides. And I've been very consistent in underutilising them. 

I had my final exams for my BSc Theoretical Physics this May, and I've felt rather floaty in the  interim, waiting to receive my final grades. When I stop and ask myself "What do I want to do?" I tend to come up quite short. I've written exhaustive lists of my interests to try and formulate the right direction to go in, but, as if adding cake to a stew, unfortunately the combination of loved  things does not necessarily improve them.

When it comes to Physics, or to be precise: "when it comes to Physics and me", it's the discovery of those parts that I'd never heard of before until that day that really make it interesting. I didn't know of the [Geodestic Equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geodesics_in_general_relativity)  $$ \
\frac{d^2 x^\mu}{d\tau^2} + \Gamma^\mu_{\nu\rho} \frac{d x^\nu}{d\tau} \frac{d x^\rho}{d\tau} = 0$$
 and it's analogous nature to the second law (in curved spacetime, the apparent acceleration of a particle arises from the Christoffel symbols, which themselves are derived from the metric,  meaning that curvature acts like a force).  Or just how interpretable [Lambda-CDM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda-CDM_model) is with a bit of guidance. Or how everything seems like it's a [Harmonic Oscillator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmonic_oscillator).
 
 If it's the unknown or unexpected or the discovered parts of things that you find out along the way that I or maybe we all enjoy, then **how can anyone plan for happiness?** So I've not figured out what I'd like to do yet. 

 <h3 style="text-align: center;"> "What kind of brain do you want to die with?"  </h3>
 <p style="text-align: right;"> - <i>An A.I. Chatbot </i> </p>
The source of this quote being an A.I. makes me anxious, but I'll decide not to read it as a threat. I think it's a good question we should all ask ourselves, as it really gets to the heart of what you strive to be. I really like the energy of this quote, it revs me up somewhat -  it makes me excited to "build the brain" I'll die with. So, if I don't know what I want to do I'll focus on building the brain I want to die with. The new question then becomes: "What do you give your brain?"

## "What should I learn?"
So I want to learn everything, of course, but I only have abouttt....

<h1 style="text-align: center;" id="post-countdown"></h1>


before I reach the end of the ride. Factor in the sleeping and the unknowable setbacks that will hit me in my future (hoping to keep all limbs at the minimum), and I give myself:

<h1 style="text-align: center;">275000  hours</h1>

to work with. And worked with, they shall be: You spend most of your time at your job!

So, if I want to use my time effectively to **have the brain I want**, it would be nice to do that at work. **So I need a job that gives me the brain that I want**. Or, a job that allows me to accumulate the most time spent on my own pursuits, to build that brain. I think there's probably two categories here: 
1.  high-earning jobs quickly provides the means to no longer focus on gathering resources.
2.  The other is minimal working / no working: maximise the time you have for your own pursuits. No security when things go wrong unforch :/

The worst place to be, where we all are, is somewhere in the [middle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EW66QdPq9-k&pp=ygUcc3R1Y2sgaW4gdGhlIG1pZGRsZSB3aXRoIHlvdQ%3D%3D). You don't really have enough free time to build the you that you want, and you probably don't earn enough to access that time when you're older.

But, hang on, what kind of brain I want is a very personal question and it won't be the same for everyone, so we'd probably part ways at this juncture, we'd all follow different careers to become what we want to be. Congratulations if you believe you've found the right path.

	I feel like boredom is a hurdle to be mounted. If you can deal with complete boredom, then you can deal with any subject matter you want - and I think curiosity is just the willingness to refuse to let boredom win. At that stage no pursue is more noble than any other, it's all just a choice to get stuck in, or to not.

So: get a really boring job, and try and make yourself as bored as possible and see what it does to you. You might figure out what you want.

My accounting interview is in 4 days....


I'm not done here, but I felt I need to post to get into a good habit of it.
